# trackmystuff

A simple CRUD application using datamapper in Sinatra. 
It was created as a learning project and is not expected to be beautiful by amy means

This is the version I pushed to Heroku initially. Others will follow.

This version uses erb and future versions will use haml, as well as ActiveRecord.
Tests will be present in future versions. THis is just the beginning!
